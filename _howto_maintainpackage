pip freeze > requirements_full.txt
## Remove unused packages from the list to generate requirements.txt

git tag -a v1.2025.07.15 -m "PyPI release"
## Don't forget to push tags (not by default in git push):  git push origin --tags or tick "push tags' in PyCharm

# Setup
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


# Build the package
python -m build


# Upload to TestPyPI (should be a new version, new file name etc)
twine upload  --repository testpypi  -u __token__ -p <YOUR_TESTPYPI_TOKEN>  dist/*

# After uploading to TestPyPI, test with:
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ statisticalRL-environments==1.2025.7.15
or
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ statisticalRL-environments

#Once setup, upload to real PYPI:

# Upload to PyPI
twine upload dist/*

#Then do:
pip install statisticalRL-environments



## To develop the package, create new Pycharm project from sub-folder "statisticalrl_environments", not direclty from root folder "environments".
## Indeed, in the final package, the root will be sub-folder "statisticalrl_environments", so everything should be correctly named
## and pycharm can't change working directroy to sub-directory (otherwise, we could simply manage one pycharm project, and indicate different work/root folder entrypoint).
## Then, I have the surrounding files for package doc, readme, etc.

## BIG TODO: If entry point is indeed statisticalrl_environments, then I shoul rename all src.statisticalrl_environments into statisticalrl_environments...
